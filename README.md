# paint-volume-prediction-ml
Machine Learning project to predict paint filling volume and classify container size (SMALL / MEDIUM / LARGE) using multiple ML models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, model comparison, and accuracy visualization.

This project applies various Machine Learning algorithms to analyze and predict paint filling quantities in a manufacturing context. The workflow includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, regression for exact volume prediction, classification for size categories, and evaluation of 5 different ML models. The repository also contains a final accuracy comparison graph and a complete project report.
